<div class="col-lg-12"><div class="article1"><div id="thess">Aris FC Thessaloniki</div></div>Aris F.C., or with its full name AC Aris Thessaloniki (Greek: Αθλητικός Σύλλογος Άρης Θεσσαλονίκης, Athletic Club Aris Thessaloniki) or Aris Thessaloniki FC (in European competitions),[1] is a Greek football club based in the city of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece, part of the major Greek multi-sports club A.C. Aris Thessaloniki. Formed in 1914, the club was a founding member of Macedonian Football Clubs Association as well as the Hellenic Football Federation. The colours of the club are yellow of glory, dominant colour in the culture of Macedonia, such as reminiscent of the Byzantine heritage of Thessaloniki, and black. It is named after Ares, the ancient Olympian "God of War", associated also with courage and masculinity, whose image is portrayed on the club's logo as depicted in the Ludovisi Ares sculpture.

<p>Nicknamed God of War, Aris were one of the most popular and strongest team in Greece during the Interwar period. They have been champions of Greece three times (1927–28, 1931–32, 1945–46), they have won the Greek Cup once (1970), and they have remained undefeated at home in European competitions since 1968 for 26 home matches [2] The team's home ground is the Kleanthis Vikelidis Stadium.</p></div>

<div class="col-lg-12"><div class="article1"><div id="thess2">
<p>Foundation and golden years</div></div>The club was established by a group of 22 young friends in a coffee bar in Votsi area on 25 March 1914 and given the name Aris from the god of war. Its nickname was inspired by the two Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, when Greece fought against the Ottoman Empire before engaging in a war with Bulgaria. In Greek mythology, Aris was a deity who was in conflict with Hercules, the mythological character after which Aris's rival football team, Iraklis, was named. Aris holds a fierce rivalry with PAOK and Olympiacos. In the beginning the club was based on a ground near the Arch and Tomb of Galerius but after the accession of two minor football clubs in 1919 and 1921 the club's base was moved near to Flemming Street. The first stadium was built on the site where Mars Field Park currently lies on Stratou Avenue. Quickly the club became very popular and soon new teams apart from football were established.</p>

<p>During this early stage of football in Greece no professional league was established. Instead, three minor leagues (in Macedonia (E.P.S.M.), Athens (E.P.S.A.) and Piraeus (E.P.S.P.)) were created, with the champions of each league competing in a postseason mini tournament to claim the title of the national champion. The first official game was held in 1923 against Megas Alexandros Thessaloniki (Alexander the Great), another Thessalonician team. That year marked the first title, when Aris was named regional champion of Macedonia, something that was repeated next year.</p>

<p>The first big success for Aris came the between 1927 to 1928 when he won the first Greek Championship, beating finalists Atromitos Athens and Ethnikos Piraeus exploiting the abstention from the championship teams of RECs. In the first race on 24 May, the team of Thessaloniki prevailed 3–1 Atromitos Athens, while three days after losing to National 3–2. In iterative matches played in June in Thessaloniki, Aris won both of his opponents by 3–1 and thus crowned the first champion of Greece. Coach of the team was the German Thomas Kessler, and prominent players of Mars was, among others, Costas Vikelidis, Savvas Vogiatzis that emerged and top scorer with six goals, Nikos Agelakis, scorer of the finals with four goals and Dionysis Caltech.</p>

<p>The following year, it was held the final stage of national championships although Aris won the championship title in Thessaloniki, playing two matches barrage against PAOK. The first took place on 12 May 1929 and ended 1–1, while the second was held on 2 June with Aris to beats 4–3, having Nick Angelaki scoring a hat-trick. </p>

<p>On 20 April 1929, the first friendly match took place between Aris and Panathinaikos, the "yellows" to defeat 5–4. The second championship came four years later in 1932, only this time his opponents were Olympiakos, Panathinaikos, AEK, Ethnikos, PAOK and Iraklis. Aris managed to collect 22 points in this mini tournament, four more than the second, Panathinaikos, scoring large wins like 7–0 against Panathinaikos, 7–3 against Iraklis and 3–0 versus AEK and Olympiakos in Athens, also new star players emerged, Kitsios, Aggelakis, Mpogdanos, Gigopoulos, while Belgian manager De Valer guided effectively the club.</p>

<p>Four years after winning the first Panhellenic title, the "yellows" won the championship. Aris became champion amassing a total of 22 points, four more than second Panathinaikos and scoring big wins like 7–0 against Panathinaikos with four goals Maywood, [10] 6–1 on Apollo Athens with six goals in the Angelaki first home appearance with the first group of Kleanthis Vikelidis, [11] 7–3 at Hercules with four goals Kitsos and away 0–3 over Olympiakos, PAOK and AEK. Leading scorer of the league emerged Nikos Kitsos with 15 goals and Nikos Agelakis to 14. </p>

<p>Big stars of that team were Kitsos, Agelakis, Caltech, and Vogdanou Gkikopoulos while coach De Valera.</p>

<p>That same year, the EPO instituted for the first time the Greek Cup, Mars crashing Panathinaikos 7–2 in the quarterfinal. This was followed by victory over Apollo Athens, to reach the final where they lost 5–3 from AEK Athens, losing the chance to win the first doubles.</p>

<p>Aris won their third title in 1946, playing against two teams, AEK from Athens and Olympiakos from Piraeus, champions of the other two minor domestic leagues. Aris beat Olympiakos twice, scoring two goals and conceding none; came to a draw with AEK in Athens and defeated them in PAOK's stadium in Thessaloniki (score 4–1). Aris has not won a championship since the establishment of the First Division (1959).</p>

<p>Up to 1959, when the united First Division was created, Aris managed to finish first 14 times in the Macedonian division.</p></div>
