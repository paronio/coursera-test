<div class="col-lg-12"><div class="article1"><div id="thess">Aris BC Thessaloniki</div></div><p>Aris Basketball Club (Greek: Άρης K.A.E., transliterated into English Aris B.S.A.) known in European competitions as Aris Thessaloniki,[4] is the professional basketball team of the major Thessaloniki-based Greek multi-sport club A.C. Aris Thessaloniki. Aris BC was founded in 1922, eight years after the founding of the club and the football team. Their traditional home ground is Alexandreio Melathron (Nick Galis Hall).</p>

<p>Aris BC is one of the most successful Greek basketball clubs of all time, tallying 10 Greek Championships, 8 Greek Cups making four times the Double (1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90). They have won also three European titles: the FIBA Saporta Cup (1992–93), the FIBA Korać Cup (1996-97) and the FIBA EuroCup Challenge (2002–03). They are also the only unrelegated team with participation in every First Division Championship until today (together with Panathinaikos BC).</p>

<p>Under the leadership of the legendary duo of Nikos Galis and Panagiotis Giannakis, Aris was the dominant force in Greek basketball during the 1980s and early 1990s. It is for this period of dominance that Aris BC has been nicknamed "The Emperor" and voted the most successful Greek sporting club of the 20th century. Aris is also one of the most renown Greek clubs in European basketball, participating in three consecutive Euroleague Final Fours, and later on winning three lower tier European titles. The historic win of the 1997 Korać Cup, in particular, bolstered the notion that Aris has a unique place in the history of Greek basketball and generally in the history of Greek sports.</p>

<p>Well-known notable players that have played with the club over the years, amongst others include Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Nikos Filippou, Lefteris Subotić, Miroslav Pecarski, Reggie Theus, Walter "The Truth" Berry, Roy Tarpley, Stojko Vranković, Žarko Paspalj, Edgar Jones, Tiit Sokk, Panagiotis Liadelis, Harold Ellis, Joe Arlauckas, Giorgos Sigalas, José Ortiz, Andrew Betts, Nikos Chatzivrettas, Nestoras Kommatos, Will Solomon, Smush Parker, Michalis Kakiouzis, Dimos Dikoudis, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Jeremiah Massey, Kostas Papanikolaou, Kostas Sloukas, Bryant Dunston and Aleksandar Vezenkov.</div></p>

<p id="legend">Legendary years</p></div></div><h3>1978 79 Greek Champions</h3>

<h3>Giannis Ioannidis</h3>
The post-war period was marked by the dominance of teams from Athens, but this all began to change in 1979. In that year, Aris won their first Greek Championship in the modern era, largely through the inspired play of Charis Papageorgiou and the coaching of Giannis Ioannidis, ex-player of the team. It helped provide the spark for the complete domination of Greek basketball by Aris during the second half of the 1980s and the early 1990s.

<h3>Nikos Galis arrives (1979)</h3>

<p>Greek basketball legend Nikos Galis, FIBA Hall of Fame inaugural inductee and widely regarded as one of the all-time greatest players in both European and FIBA International basketball history.
If that first championship was the spark, then the fuel for Aris' brilliant stint at the top of the sport was undoubtedly Nikos Galis, thought by the vast majority of Greek basketball fans to be the best Greek basketball player of all time, and one of the best ever in Europe. Galis, the son of Rhodian immigrants from New Jersey, signed on in October 1979 and played his first game against Iraklis Thessaloniki in December of that year, scoring 30 points. Fred Develey, the former coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv who became later coach of Aris, was instrumental in convincing the management that Galis would not only change the Greek basketball, but he would change also the Greek basketball in Europe. The management was more concerned about his lack of height than his ability, until they saw him play.</p>

<h3>1982–83 Greek Champions</h3>
<p>It would take another four years for Aris to rise to the top again, winning the national championship in 1983, with Galis taking the game in Greece to new heights, showing coordination and creativity then (some would argue even now) unprecedented in Greek courts, and almost single handedly beating powerhouse rivals like Olympiacos and Panathinaikos. That year also marked the return of Giannis Ioannidis to the Aris bench.</p>

<p>A very successful 1983–1984 season had a bitter ending, as Aris battled for both the Greek Championship and the Greek Cup but lost the national cup final to crosstown rivals PAOK and the league championship game to Panathinaikos Athens under dubious circumstances. A taste of things to come, however, had been offered during Aris' games against Maccabi Tel Aviv in the qualifying round for the Euroleague in the fall of 1983. Aris was narrowly eliminated by the very powerful Israeli League team, but not before posting an away win at Tel Aviv, something that no other European team had managed to do for many years.</p>

<h3>The coming of Giannakis and the domination in Greece
1985–1991: 7 consecutive Greek Championships (5 Doubles)</h3>

<h3>Panagiotis Giannakis</h3>
<p>Disappointment did not get much in the way of Aris' progress. With the financial support of Akis Michailides, a successful businessman and president of the team, probably the most crucial transfer in Greece occurred after the 1983–1984 season, bringing Panagiotis Giannakis to Aris from Ionikos Nikea. Nikos Galis now had a first-class partner. The result was a total carnage for other teams. The lethal back court blazed through the Greek League for seven consecutive years, with the help of players such as Nikos Filippou, Michalis Romanidis, Lefteris Subotic, Doxakis, Vassilis Lipiridis and others, winning 7 championships, and 5 cups (and one cup being memorably lost to Panathinaikos in 1986, with Galis performing surprisingly poorly in a single-elimination game in Athens). Especially between 1985–1988, the question was not who the champion would be, but if Aris would go undefeated or not, as the club won an unparalleled 81 games in a row at one point.</p>

<h3>European distinction</h3>
<p>In 1984–1985 came Aris' first significant European success: Aris reached the semifinals of the Korać Cup, eventually losing to Pallacanestro Varese of the Italian League and without the services of Galis for the first game in Thessaloniki (he was injured in practice 3 days before the game).</p>

<p>Aris formed the backbone of the Greek national team, sending Galis, Giannakis, Filippou, Romanidis, and Lipiridis (to help Greece win the gold medal in EuroBasket 1987 and the silver medal in EuroBasket 1989). The back court of Galis-Giannakis first came to European prominence in the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain, where upstarts Greece performed surprisingly well, while Galis won the top-scorer award.</p>

<p>It was during that year, 1986, that Aris made the news in Europe in the Euroleague qualifying round. Having been unceremoniously eliminated by Limoges of The French League in 1985, Aris was arbitrarily paired against Olimpia Milano in the qualifying round. An insurmountable task, considering that Olimpia were arguably the best team in Europe and furthermore had acquired Bob McAdoo, possibly the best American player (still) to ever play in Europe. Aris, sporting Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Lefteris Subotić, and a third rate American player, Jackson, managed an unbelievable win in Thessaloniki by 31 points, almost assuring the elimination of Olimpia and advancing into the final group of the 6 best European teams. However, the return leg saw Olimpia winning by 34 points and eliminating Aris, since Galis was absent due to an injury problem.</p>

<p>Aris had to wait for another year to compete in Europe again, but their strength had been established. In 1987 Aris was not paired against an established team and thus advanced to the final round of the 8 best European champions. The same was achieved in the next four years, and while Aris did not win the Champions' Cup they were very successful in the tournaments, reaching the final-four in 1987, 1988, and 1989. By then Aris had become a household name in basketball in Europe.</p>

<h3>Favourite team in Greece</h3>
<p>The most important contribution of Aris to the Greek basketball was the establishment of the sport in Greece as an almost pure spectacle. Aris (chiefly through the play of Nikos Galis) elevated the measly standards that existed among teams to heights that demanded the attention of the sports fans. It was a team that mesmerized audiences used to boring styles of play, and showed flashes of brilliance night in and night out. The fervent desire to see the team they supported win, quite evident in Greek people, succumbed to the enjoyment that the fans received from watching a team perform in such an entertaining fashion while dismantling their opponents.</p>

<p>Arenas were completely sold out wherever Aris was playing, opponents' fans were applauding Aris for their performance, and streets were empty when Aris played European games, as Greeks throughout the country were glued to their TV sets to watch the inspired play of Galis and company. Such was the impact that basketball overtook football as the most popular sport in Greece. For example: Aris was playing basketball with other European teams every Thursday night. Since then and up to 2003, every Thursday night cinemas in Greece offered tickets at reduced prices.</p>

<h3>The Aris PAOK rivalry</h3>
<p>Special reference must be made to the rivalry between Aris and PAOK. Fierce rivals in all sports, the Aris and PAOK basketball face-offs had a distinct flavor between 1985 and 1992, as those were the two top teams in Greece. In games where a defeat is more than a lost game, the mood of most of the fans of either Aris or PAOK is quite seriously affected for some time following a defeat to their opponents.</p>


<h3>Zvi Sherf, coach of the team (1992–93)</h3>
<p>The most memorable game was the third playoff game between the two teams in 1991. Aris had a 2-game lead from the regular season, but PAOK managed to even the score with 2 victories in the first 2 playoff games, so, naturally, they had the momentum going into the 5th game of the best-of-seven series. PAOK was up by 4 points almost 10 seconds before the end of that 5th game. What followed left scars in many PAOK fans: Panagiotis Giannakis scored a quick 2-point basket, reducing the deficit to 2 points. A sloppy inbounds pass was stolen by Dinos Angelidis, who passed the ball to Nikos Galis, who (guarded by a frenzied John Korfas) started to penetrate, but then passed the ball to Giannakis, who drilled a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Aris went on to win the next playoff game and thus the 1991 championship.</p>

<h3>1992–93 FIBA European Cup Winners</h3>
<p>In 1992 Aris won the Greek Cup, versus AEK Athens. That final was quite significant since it marked Galis' last game for Aris. The player who almost by himself made basketball hugely popular in Greece had won 8 Greek Championships and 6 Greek Cups with Aris in 13 years.</p>

<p>The team management made what was proven to be a mistake in their plans for the 1992–93 season. The president (Mitroudis) in cooperation with Steve Giatzoglou (the new coach) decided to build the new team around Giannakis instead of Galis. Even though Roy Tarpley was signed and Aris was dominating in the start, things fell apart and irresponsible management in conjunction with lack of discipline led to the 5th spot in the final standings of the Greek League. However, a European success came for the team as Aris won the European Cup, beating Efes Pilsen 48–50 in a very dramatic game and winning their first European title.</p></div>
