<div class="col-lg-12"><div class="article1"><div id="thess">Aris Fans</div></div><p>Aris' fan base is spread across all the economic classes in the city of Thessaloniki and the greater region of Greece.[11] Their rivalry is against clubs such as arch-rival PAOK, but also against the biggest clubs of Athens Olympiacos Piraeus, Panathinaikos and AEK Athens.[12] The most intense rivalries are those against PAOK AEK Athens and Olympiacos Piraeus . PAOK because it is the local derby and an event that splits Thessaloniki and Northern Greece in two. Olympiacos because Aris fans believe that Olympiacos controls the whole system of greek football. Finally AEK because in an Aris-AEK Athens game in 1995 in Kleanthis Vikelides Stadium an AEK fan named Nikos Xirokostas was badly injured and stayed disabled. The most fanatic part of Aris fans usually holds the eastern part of the Kleanthis Vikelides Stadium, called Gate 3. Aris' main fan club is Super 3. It exist since 1988 with 50 more Super 3 clubs spread all over Greece and Europe. There are over 12.000 Super 3 members. In the rest of Europe there are also some organized Aris' fan clubs in countries such as Germany, Italy and Sweden. According to some polls Aris is the 5th most popular team in Greece with around a million fans, an amount quite big considering the lack of titles for many decades.</p>

<p>Against Panathinaikos during the 2010 Greek Cup final 30,000 Aris fans descended to Athens to what has been described as the biggest football fans move in Greece.</p>

<p>Aris fans are loosely connected with the supporters of AS Saint-Ã‰tienne (Green Angels 92), Boca Juniors,[15] such as Borussia Dortmund (also due to the same colours).During the 2013/2014 season, a large number of the Aris Fanbase and a large number of the Watford FC fanbase called The 1881 have forged a strong friendship and are actively going to games with each other in both Watford and Aris.</p></div>
